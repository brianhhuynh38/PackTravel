## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

This section guides you through submitting a bug report. Following these guidelines helps maintainers and the community understand your report :pencil:, reproduce the behavior :computer: :computer:, and find related reports :mag_right:.

> **Note:** If you find a **Closed** issue that seems like it is the same thing that you're experiencing, open a new issue and include a link to the original issue in the body of your new one.
#### Before Submitting A Bug Report

* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/brianhhuynh38/PackTravel/issues)

* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/brianhhuynh38/PackTravel/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

#### How Do I Submit the fixes for the Bug?

* **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the problem.
* **Describe the exact steps which reproduce the problem** in as many details as possible.
* **Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps**. Include links to files or GitHub projects, or copy/pasteable snippets, which you use in those examples. If you're providing snippets in the issue, use [Markdown code blocks](https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/#multiple-lines).
* **Describe the behavior you observed after following the steps** and point out what exactly is the problem with that behavior.
* **Explain which behavior you expected to see instead and why.**
* **Include screenshots and animated GIFs** which clearly demonstrates the problem.
* **If the problem wasn't triggered by a specific action**, describe what you were doing before the problem happened and share more information using the guidelines below.
* **Open a new GitHub pull request** with the patch.
* **Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution.**

### Suggesting Enhancements

This section guides you through submitting an enhancement suggestion, including completely new features and minor improvements to existing functionality. Following these guidelines helps maintainers and the community understand your suggestion :pencil: and find related suggestions :mag_right:.

* **Drop an [email](mailto:help@packtravel.io) suggesting your change and start writing code.**
* **Do not open an issue on GitHub until you have collected positive feedback about the change. GitHub issues are primarily intended for bug reports and fixes.**


### Pull Requests

The process described here has several goals:

- Maintain Atom's quality
- Fix problems that are important to users
- Engage the community in working toward the best possible Atom
- Enable a sustainable system for Atom's maintainers to review contributions

Please follow these steps to have your contribution considered by the maintainers:

1. Only touch relevant files
2. Make sure your code is clean
3. Make sure you unit test your changes
4. Keep your commit history short and clean
5. Write a convincing description of your PR and why we should land it.

While the prerequisites above must be satisfied prior to having your pull request reviewed, the reviewer(s) may ask you to complete additional design work, tests, or other changes before your pull request can be ultimately accepted.


Thanks!
